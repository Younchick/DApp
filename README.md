# DApp
First DApp with possibility to connect to your metamask, send ETH and also added ERC20 protocols 
Now I'm trying to add a feature that will help you send a bitcoins, and that you be able to connect to your wallet and do transaction using you private key.
Also them main file with code is script.js, main.js, ui.js, ethreum.js it's just a examples for me cos I'm trying to convert my code in to SOLID principal code
