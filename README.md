# DApp
First DApp with possibility to connect to your metamask, send ETH and also added ERC20 protocols.
Now I'm trying to add a feature that will help you send a bitcoins with posibility to connect to your wallet and do transactions using your private key.
Also the main file with code is script.js, main.js, ui.js, ethreum.js it's just a examples for me cos I'm trying to convert my code in to SOLID principal code
